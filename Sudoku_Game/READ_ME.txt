Sudoku Game is an assignment of AI LAB, BUET CSE Level-4 Term-1, developed by Ahsan Ali 1105083. This is developed using java jdk7.
Sudoku Game is a simple strategy game. The objective is to fill a 9X9 grid with digits so that each column, each row and each of
the nine 3X3 subgrids (boxes) contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

New Game provides a partially completed grid. Anyone can check if sudoku is solved by clicking Check button and get solved game 
by clicking Solve button. As Sudoku game is a Constrained Stratification Problem so the solution of Sudoku Board is generated 
by Backtracking with Forward Checking, MRV and Value First heuristics.

Both 32bit and 64bit version jar file are in /Sudoku_x86 and /Sudoku_x64 folder and source code is in /Sudoku_Source_Code folder.
