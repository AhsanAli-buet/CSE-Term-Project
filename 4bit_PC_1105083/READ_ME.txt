4bit PC is Digital System Design LAB Project of BUET CSE Level-4 term-1, team members Ahsan Ali 1105083,
Al Habib Rahman 1105064, Khondokar Solaiman 1105082, Golam Saklain Ratul 1105069.

This the proteus simulation of 4bit PC which used 8bit BUS and executes 28 instructions. Full Details of this project is 
described in 4bit_PC_Final_Report.pdf. The operation codes of 28 instructions and theirs hex values are in 4bit_PC_OpCODE.xlsx
file and the signal bits for instructions (4 ROM output of control unit) are in 4bit_PC_final_ROM_Hex.xlsx file.

Configuring ROM(opcode input,ASCHEX) stored in RAM of design file is mandotory to run the 4bit_PC simulation in Proteus.
The main design file of 4bit_PC is in /4bitPC_083_Final/4bit_PC_83.DSN (proteus design file). Component of RAM,ALU in this
design file are implemented in child sheet. In /4bitPC_083_Final/rom or rom_TEST folder OPCODE.bin and test*.bin are 
input binary file and ROM1-ROM4.bin are for Control Unit (must not change).
